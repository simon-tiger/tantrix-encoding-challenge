    <h1>Tantrix Tile Encoding Challenge</h1>
    <p>I'm trying to make Tantrix, but I need the tiles for it.
       And I would get tired if I would just make them myself.
       So I thought, if I ask other people to do it for me,
       then I would be able to get to the coding straight
       away without me making the dataset!</p>
    <h2>Format</h2>
    <img src="img1.png"></img>
    <p>So the 1st and 2nd position are in one question,
       and the color in the other one.
       These questions are there for each link.
       The layering order of the links is asked in the
       last question.
       If the order isn't selected, the order is simply
       1 2 3.</p>

    <p>Tile to make: tile #<span id="tilenumber"></span> (see the wikipedia page to make sure the tile has the correct pattern corresponding to this number)</p>
